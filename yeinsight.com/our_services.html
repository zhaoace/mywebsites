                                                <p>To meet the needs of yogurt Brand A, we worked out a tailored research plan, which can be divided into three stages:  </p>
                                                <ul class="dot">
                                                    <li>Stage One (preliminary research). We randomly interviewed 3000 consumers by means of CATI to obtain data concerning penetration rate and market size of yogurts in mainland China. CATI was used for two reasons. Firstly, with 90% and 70% of Mainland citizens using telephones and mobile phones respectively, we had access to a large group of respondents. Secondly, the computer phone-number database provides us with random samples.</li>
                                                    <li>Stage Two (in-depth research). We organized 21 focus groups to better understand the consumers' attitude, motivation and thoughts about different yogurt sub-categories. Focus groups were held for three reasons. Firstly, an in-depth research requires more open-ended discussions. Secondly, featuring constant interaction, focus groups allow researchers to collect more valuable information. Thirdly, the pattern of focus groups is flexible enough for researchers to identify new questions and facilitate further discussion.</li>
                                                    <li>Stage Three (zoom-in research). Setting quota for different yogurt sub-categories, we interviewed 2,100 consumers by means of central location test (CLT) in order to make quantitative analysis on consumer behavior and brand performance. CLT was used for two reasons. Firstly, it enables us to approach large consumer groups. Secondly, it fulfills the sample quota more easily.</li>

                                                <p>Cosmetic Brand A intends to launch new products in tier 2-3 cities of China. With current concentration on tier 1 cities, however, Brand A knows little about consumers in tier 2-3 cities. Can its past success in tier 1 be reproduced in tier 2-3 cities? What are the characteristics of the consumers there?  What are vital to the brand’s R&D and marketing planning?</p>

Online survey is carried out for the following reasons. 1) Random: random sampling reflects the market specifics. 2) Comprehensive: online surveys overcome geological limitations and ensure high response rate in representative areas. 3) Cost saving: large expenses for business trips are saved. 4) Feasible: our professional database of cosmetics consumers gives access to larger population and makes the sample more representative.</p>

                                                <p>Our research findings have helped Brand A to better understand the characteristics of cosmetic consumption by women in tier 2-3 cities.</p>

                                                    <li>Compared with consumers from tier 1 cities, those from tier 2 values more the flaw-hiding effect of cosmetics while their skin-care awareness is weaker.</li>
                                                    <li>Women from tier 2-3 cities tend to spend less in single consumption but with slightly higher frequency. Their total consumption is only slightly lower than that of tier 1 cities, which suggests market potential in 2-3 cities.</li>
                                                    <li>While franchised stores and counters remain favorite places for female consumers in tier 2-3 cities, a small number of them have started trying online purchasing as those in tier 1 city do. This suggests that online marketing will become more important.</li>
                                                    <li>The tier 2-3 market is dominated by four major cosmetics brands. This shows that marketing segmentation is highly necessary as the market is still segmented with diverse consumer demands.</li>
                                                    <li>The female consumer loyalty to cosmetics brand is lower in tier 2-3 cities, giving new brands opportunities to enter and old ones challenges to retain clients.</li>
                                                    <li>Based on a Market Segmentation Model, we divide the female consumers in tier 2-3 cities into six types, namely function buyer, fashion buyer, popularly-oriented, health buyer, consumption leader and rationally-oriented. By profiling and positioning each type of consumers, we have helped clients to devise effective marketing strategies.</li>

                                                    <li>Visual impact: On the whole, the visual impact is rated as good because of the spokesperson. Respondents receive information through three sources in descending order of importance: spokesperson, ipad and slogan. However, the logo attracted very little attention from them.</li>
                                                    <li>Overall visual assessment: respondents give favorable comments on the overall effect mainly because of the spokesperson.

                                                    <li>Room for improvement: With the prominent images of ipad, the respondents mistake the designs for advertising ipad. To leave consumers with a lasting impression, the website has to highlight its feature more effectively. Although the advertisement is of higher quality and artistic criterion than the average, it is expected to show more originality.</li>

                                                        <p>In the fierce competitions among menswear brands, brand effect is the core. The brand development strategy of Company A, a clothing brand is neither in line with its vision nor the current market and therefore needs an urgent transformation. The Company intends to use consumer research to diagnose problems in the current stage of brand development and understand fundamental aspects of the brand. Through consumer research, it also hopes to gain more insights into its competitors and the market trends, thus making better preparations for its annual brand promotions.</p>

                                                        <p>In order to reach more consumers from cities of lower tiers and make the sample more representative, an online sampling survey was carried out to collect information of 4,200 samples from 14 provinces (including municipal cities and autonomous regions). </p>
                                                        <p>Upon a thorough evaluation and examination of the company’s brand, we discovered that the brand was not as strong as it looked. Although it had seen an increase in both popularity and sales through strong advertising and wide distribution channels, its marketing strategies were not sustainable for two reasons. Firstly, philosophy presented in the advertising is not closely linked to the brand. Secondly, both the stores and products cannot deliver what the brand exactly stands for. Therefore, in spite of large sales volume, the brand has yet to become a leader in the menswear filed, as customers are not so emotionally attached as to remain loyal to the brand. </p>

Then we asked chief physicians who use medical equipment in over 400 top hospitals across the country via CATI and appointed interviews to evaluate products of this manufacturer and those of its competitors in terms of the whole sales process and product functions. Based on the satisfaction assessment model, consumer structural analytic tool and the importance/consumer satisfaction matrix, we conducted in-depth data analysis and came to the following conclusions.</p>
